simulation thread keep running after closing window
link tool let you atach a single lane to two diffrent lanes
junction icon is totally unusable remove it from tool bar
traffic composition doesnot work correctly when it is atched to a road (I did not comprehend it well it is working fine)
remove traffic source of a road and add it again it will not be added the second time - not sure (the issue was not reproducing probably it was a comprehension issue)
removing road does not remove the traffic source and road custimization related to simulation which causes exception
add a prototype, use it in a traffic composition, then remove the prototype, composition remains the same and upon reading the tag it throws an obvisois error that such prototype doesnot exist, it happen with both generic and road level composition
upon deleting a road, relivent signal is not removed from controler tag (.xodr) and its phase is not removed from TrafficLights (.xprj) - unable to reproduce the issue
junction information is not correctly written in files neither it is loaded from files correctly

if road is deleted coresponding routes still carries that road id

route up stream issue
if there is no link between two roads and a route is defnied, simulation crashes with an exception
if a route is removed Output configuration remain there in .xprj file
lane cardinility infact all sorts of cardinalities are not being inforced and taken care by the tool
route validity could be checked by folloing the succseer trail
It is unknown why it shows white lines! does not make any sense how it is working
